# WAST: Ergonomic Code Generation

Release **{sub-ref}`release`**

`wast` (stands for "Wolphin Abstract Syntax Tree") is the Python package that will make code generation **practical** and **ergonomic**

It was originally intended for advanced Python developers who are interested in reducing boilerplate code while working on libraries with huge API surface

Python AST node are represented using `attrs` based classes with validators preventing logical mistakes and converters enabling simple shortcuts

Autogenerated from [Python.asdl](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Parser/Python.asdl) found in CPython source tree.
And uses previous version of itself for generating newer version.
So a process similar to compiler bootstraping was required (first versions were written using built-in Python AST)


# Getting started

`wast` is hosted on PyPI, so installation is as simple as:

```bash
$ pip3 install wast
```

The next steps will get you up and running in no time:

- {doc}`getting_started` will show you a simple example of `wast` in action and introduce you to its philosophy.
